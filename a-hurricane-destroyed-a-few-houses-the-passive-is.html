</p><p></p><p><strong>PEMBAHASAN:</strong></p><p>Passive voice merupakan suatu bentuk kalimat dimana subjek kalimat menerima aksi, bukan melakukan aksi. Tidak seperti active voice yang fokus terhadap pihak yang melakukan aksi (doer of action), bentuk ini lebih berfokus kepada pihak atau objek yang menerima hasil dari suatu aksi tersebut (receiver of action).
</p><p>Kalimat aktif yang bisa dirubah menjadi kalimat pasif berbentuk kalimat aktif yang mengandung transitive verbs (kata kerja yang memerlukan objek langsung) seperti make, bring, buy, write dan sebagainya. Sebaliknya, kalimat pasif yang mengandung intransitive verbs (kata kerja yang tidak memerlukan objek langsung) seperti cry, swim, go, arrive, dan die tidak bisa diubah menjadi kalimat pasif. Tetapi, apabila intransitive verbs tersebut diikuti oleh preposition, ada kemungkinan kalimat tersebut bisa diubah menjadi kalimat pasif tetapi kalimat pasif yang terbentuk akan sangat kaku.
</p><p>Rumus Kalimat Pasif ( Passive Voice)
</p><p>Subject(object dari kalimat aktif) + to be ( disesuaikan dengan bentuk tensesnya + Verb 3 (past participle)
</p><p>TENSES                                           RUMUS PASSIVE VOICE
</p><p>Simple present                            subject + is/am/are + Verb 3
</p><p>Present continuous             subject + is/am/are + being + Verb 3
</p><p>Present perfect                        subject + have/has been + Verb 3
</p><p>Simple past                                 subject + was/were + Verb 3
</p><p>Past continuous               subject + was/were + being + Verb 3
</p><p>Past perfect                              subject + had been + Verb 3
</p><p>Simple future                            subject + will be + Verb 3
</p><p>Be going to                subject + is/am/are + going to + be + Verb 3
</p><p>Future continuous               subject + will + be + being + Verb 3
</p><p>Future perfect                       subject + will have been + Verb 3
</p><p>Modal                                         subject + modal + be + Verb 3
</p><p>
</p><p>Langkah-langkah (tips) membentuk kalimat pasif (Passive Voice) dari kalimat aktif:
</p>Pilih objek penderita dari kalimat aktif itu
Buatlah objek tersebut menjadi subjek dari kalimat pasifnya
Perhatiakan bentuk tensesnya, subjeknya tunggal atau jamak karena tenses yang di gunakan harus sama
Bentuklah predikatnya dengan to be + Verb 3
