When his mother came near him, Malin Kundang who was with his beautiful wife and his ship crews denied that she was his mother. She had pleaded Malin Kundang to look at her and admit that she was her mother. But he kept refusing to do it and yelling at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her "Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!" After that he ordered his crews to set sail to leave the old woman who was then full of sadness and anger. Finally, feeling enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn't apologize to her. Malin Kundang just laughed and set sail. Suddenly a thunderstorm came in the quiet sea, wrecking his huge ship. He was thrown out to a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse, he had turned into a stone.</p><p></p><p></p><p>___________________________________</p><br />

They didn’t earn much as fishing was their only source of income. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always helps his mother to earn some money. However, as they were only fisherman’s helper, they still lived in poverty. “Mother, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang one day to his mother. Her mother didn’t agree but Malin Kundang had made up his mind. “Mother, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person,” urged Malin kundang. His mother wiped her tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you. I could only pray to God for you to gain success in life,” said his mother wisely. “But, promise me, you’ll come home.”</p><p>In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go. Three days ago, he met one of the successful ship’s crew. Malin was offered to join him. “Take a good care of yourself, son,” said Malin Kundang’s mother as she gave him some food supplies. “Yes, Mother,” Malin Kundang said. “You too have to take a good care of yourself. I’ll keep in touch with you,” he continued before kissing his mother’s hand.

Every day and night, she prayed to the God for her son’s safety. There was so much prayer that had been said due to her deep love for Malin Kundang. Even though it’s been a year she had not heard any news from Malin Kundang, she kept waiting and praying for him.</p><p>After several years waiting without any news, Malin Kundang’s mother was suddenly surprised by the arrival of a big ship in the pier where she usually stood to wait for her son. When the ship finally pulled over, Malin Kundang’s mother saw a man who looked wealthy stepping down a ladder along with a beautiful woman. She could not be wrong. Her blurry eyes still easily recognized him. The man was Malin Kundang, her son.</p><p>Malin Kundang’s mother quickly went to see her beloved son. “Malin, you’re back, son!” said Malin Kundang’s mother and without hesitation, she came running to hug Malin Kundang, “I miss you so much.” But, Malin Kundang didn’t show any respond. He was ashamed to admit his own mother in front of his beautiful wife. “You’re not my Mother. I don’t know you. My mother would never wear such ragged and ugly clothes,” said Malin Kundang as he release his mother embrace.</p><p>Malin Kundang’s mother take a step back, “Malin…You don’t recognize me? I’m your mother!” she said sadly. Malin Kundang’s face was as cold as ice. “Guard, take this old women out of here,” Malin Kundang ordered his bodyguard. “Give her some money so she won’t disturb me again!” Malin Kundang’s mother cried as she was dragged by the bodyguard, ”Malin… my son. Why do you treat your own mother like this?”</p><p>Malin Kundang ignored his mother and ordered the ship crews to set sail. Malin Kundang’s mother sat alone in the pier. Her heart was so hurt, she cried and cried. “Dear God, if he isn’t my son, please let him have a save journey. But if he is, I cursed him to become a stone,” she prayed to the God.</p><p>In the quiet sea, suddenly the wind blew so hard and a thunderstorm came. Malin Kundang’s huge ship was wrecked. He was thrown by the wave out of his ship, and fell on a small island. Suddenly, his whole body turned into stone. He was punished for not admitting his own mother.</p><p> </p><p>SEMOGA MEMEBANTU:)</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                        Malin Kundang<br /><br /><br />Long time ago, there was a poor family which consisted of a mother and her only son, Malin Kudang. Malin’s father was gone, when he was a baby. Malin’s mother worked so hard all day, so they could eat and survive. <br /><br /><br />Malin was a good smart boy; but he was little bit naughty. He always helped her mother. He loved her so much. Time went fast, Malin grew up to be a good looking, smart, and strong man. Even though he and her mother had worked so hard, they were still poor. Feeling sad seeing his mother still worked in her elderly time, Malin asked for leaving to find a job in a big city.<br /><br /><br />“Ma, I want to go to big city to find a job.” asked Malin.<br /><br />“Don’t leave me alone, son” said his mother.<br /><br />“I need to go, Ma. I don’t want to see you work hard anymore. I promise I’ll come back.” said Malin.<br /><br /><br />With hard feeling, Malin’s mother let her son go. The next day Malin went to the big city by a ship. Malin was good looking, smart, and strong man. Many women felt in love with him, including a daughter of the richest merchant in the city. Malin also felt in love with her too. To marry the girl, Malin worked so hard. He even buried all his past; his origin and even his own mother. In short, they finally married. Malin then became the richest man in the city with many merchant ships, a big beautiful house, and many servants. <br /><br /><br />Malin was prosperous at the moment, but he forgot his own mother. He forgot his mother who in all her prays wept praying for Malin’s safety. He forgot his mother who always waited her son came back every morning in the harbor. He forget his mother who loved and missed her son, Malin, so much. Yet, Malin never came back.<br /><br /><br />One day, Malin’s wife wanted to go vacation in the next island which took 3 days sailing. So Malin prepared his big luxurious ship and everything to sail. However, in the middle of his voyage, storm blockaded his ship. Therefore, the ship needed to board in the closest island, the island where Malin was born. <br /><br /><br />It was rare occasion, a big luxurious ship boarded in the harbor of the island where all the villagers are fisherman. So, when the ship boarded, every villager near the harbor came to see, including Malin’s mother. Malin’s mother was shock and wept happily. She saw Malin in that ship. She saw Malin came back to see his mother. With hurry, Malin’s mother went to meet her beloved son.<br /><br /><br />“Is that you, Malin? Is that you, my beloved son? I’m your mother, you remember?” asked Malin’s mother.<br /><br />“Son? She said you are her son? Is it true, Malin? Is this poor, old, stink woman your mother? ” Malin’s wife shocked.<br /><br />“No.. No, my dear wife. I don’t know this poor woman. I don’t know you poor, old, stink woman!” said Malin.<br /><br /><br />What Malin said really hurt his mother heart. She cried and wept. She didn’t believe that her own son did terrible thing on her, his mother. With anger, she prayed to the almighty God to reply what her son had done to her.<br /><br /><br />Suddenly, the wind blew hard and the storm rumbled. Malin and his wife returned to the ship take shelter. The storm got worst and hit Malin’s hip, destroyed it. Everyone inside was died, including Malin’s wife. Malin himself was cursed. His body was turned to stone and allied with the reef.<br /><br /><br />
