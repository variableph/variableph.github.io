Every year, our school held scout activities which must be followed by all 7th grade students and at the end of each semester there were camp activities held at the school.</p><p>When the D-day arrived, before the activity began the opening ceremony was held to get information and direction during the camp activities. After that, my team mate and I immediately set up a tent that was assisted by a coach. After the tent was established, we immediately arranged the equipment we had brought. Shortly, the whistle rang, I quickly put on a tie and other scout gear because there would be a game between teams to train the cohesiveness and togetherness of each team. Then there was heavy rain. Considering that all the equipment was in the tent, the school finally decided that all students would take refuge in the hall, let the conditions where it was not possible to come in because there were several tents which had collapsed by the wind, and the field were very muddy. Arriving at the hall, we immediately rushed to the bathroom to change our clothes. </p><p>After each team gathered according to each class, everyone got a box of rice which could be enjoyed together. After dinner, the rain stopped. We went straight to the courtyard to enjoy the campfire and watch the performances of each team, in the form of songs and poems. After the campfire event was over, the school announced that the female students in that night must sleep in the meeting room, while the men remained in the hall. Finally we were moved again. In our hearts, we were very happy because of the meeting room has an air conditioner, and it might not be fair for men to have to sleep without air conditioner.</p><p>The next morning at around 5 a.m, all students had to get up and get ready, because morning exercise would be held. After that, we enjoyed the breakfast together. We didn't forget to clear the tent that had collapsed and saved it again. Around 8 o'clock, we prepared for the closing ceremony.

<p>My Fun First Day At School</p>
<p>This is one of my most cherished memories of my childhood. I started school probably at age of 5 or 6.</p>
<p>On my first day, my mom dressed me up 
and packed my bags while my dad did my tie. My parents and I drove to 
the school building and wow it was huge!! I was just amazed by the 
sight! So dad steps out of the car and opens the door for me. He takes 
me by my hand and we walk slowly towards school. My mom stays behind and
 starts to cry (I remember quite vividly – and I even remember me 
starting to cry, telling her “I want to go back home!” Still dad didn’t 
take my request and we walked. I was crying and shocked when I entered 
the building. Dad did the registration, met my teacher and hugged me for
 the last time and off he went. I kinda came late to class and I saw all
 the kids already there. I was blushing. I had a great day! Made lots of
 friends and played around.</p><br /><br />

                        The Amazing School Trip To Bali<br /><br />When I was in Junior High School, my classmates and I went to Bali for a school trip.  We had to take a bus from Madiun to Bali. It took us almost the whole day to get to Bali. However, the bus trip was so much fun because my classmates were very entertaining.<br /><br />After we arrived in Bali, we went straight to the  Monkey Temple. In that place, we could see a lot of cheeky yet cute monkeys. One monkey managed to steal my friend's water bottle. It was hilarious! I couldn't stop laughing at him. <br /><br />Next, we went to Nusa Dua Beach. My friends and I decided to ride "banana boat". After trying to bargain for half hour with the vendor, we finally managed to get a decent price. The banana boat turned out to be the coolest thing we did in Bali. We rode a boat that looked like a banana, and it was pulled by a boat. The boat kept on making a U turn quickly until we are all fell off the boat. It was such a great experience!<br /><br />Finally, it was time to end the trip. We had to say goodbye to Bali. I felt so sad but I couldn't really do anything. However, I knew I will go back to Bali again one day. With that thought in mind, I finally was able to get on the bus and went back to Madiun. <br /><br />Hope this helps!<br />

I think it was small light object and easy to ride it. I persuaded my father to teach me to ride ” Honda 75 “. Firstly, my father refused my request and promised that he would teach me two or three years later, but I still whimpered. Finally, my father surrendered and promised to teach me.<br />He began to teach me riding the motorcycle around a field in my village. My father was very patient to give me some directions. I was very happy when I realized my ability to ride a motorcycle. ” Yes, I can “.<br />One day later, when I was alone at home, I intended to try my riding ability. So, myself tried bravely. All ran fluently in the beginning, but when I was going back to my home and I must passed through a narrow slippery street, I got nervous. I lost my control and I fell to the ditch.<br />After that, I told my father about the last accident. I imagined my father would be angry and never let me ride again. But the reality is exactly on the contrary, my father was very proud of me. He just gave me some advices and since that accident, I got my father’s permission to ride motorcycle.<br /><br />Artinya;<br />Pengalaman teman saya Mengendarai Sepeda Motor<br />Suatu hari, ketika saya berusia sepuluh tahun, ayah saya membeli sebuah sepeda motor tua. Itu adalah “Honda 75”. Kupikir itu benda ringan kecil dan mudah mengendarainya. Saya membujuk ayah saya untuk mengajari saya naik “Honda 75″. Pertama, ayah saya menolak permintaan saya dan berjanji akan mengajari saya dua atau tiga tahun kemudian, tapi saya masih merintih. Akhirnya, ayah saya menyerah dan berjanji untuk mengajari saya.<br />Dia mulai mengajari saya mengendarai sepeda motor di sekitar lapangan di desaku. Ayah saya sangat sabar untuk memberi saya beberapa petunjuk. Saya sangat senang saat menyadari kemampuan saya mengendarai sepeda motor. ” Ya saya bisa “.<br />Suatu hari nanti, saat saya sendirian di rumah, saya bermaksud mencoba kemampuan berkuda saya. Jadi, saya sendiri mencoba dengan gagah berani. Semua berjalan lancar sejak awal, tapi saat aku kembali ke rumahku dan aku harus melewati jalan licin yang sempit, aku menjadi gugup. Saya kehilangan kendali dan jatuh ke selokan.<br />Setelah itu, saya memberi tahu ayah saya tentang kecelakaan terakhir. Saya membayangkan ayah saya akan marah dan tidak pernah membiarkan saya naik lagi. Tapi kenyataannya justru sebaliknya, ayah saya sangat bangga dengan saya. Dia hanya memberi saya beberapa nasihat dan sejak kecelakaan itu, saya mendapat izin ayah saya untuk mengendarai sepeda motor.<br /><br />semoga membantu...<br />

                        A Beautiful Day on Parangtritis Beach<br />Last holiday, my family and I went to Parangtritis beach in Yogyakarta. We had arrived in Yogyakarta several days before. We had gone around the city and at the last day we finally came to the beach and we rent a cottage near it. We arrived at 10 o’clock in the morning. It was a perfect time to enjoy the beach. The scenery was so wonderful and I felt that the sun kissed me though its bright light. I felt blessed because I could enjoy one of God’s masterpieces. My parents sat together under their umbrella. My younger brothers played sand. My older sister took her self picture and I enjoyed the wind blowing.<br />My mother had prepared a bucket of foods and some drinks for us. She had arranged to have a picnic time at the beach. She brought many bread toast with beef and cheese on it, some fruit salads, and orange juice. Those were so fresh and perfect companion for the perfect moment we had. After having picnic, my father challenged us to fly with paragliding. That was an amazing offer for me. But, my sister seemed afraid of it. Then, we accepted the challenge. I was so excited, and so were my brothers. My mother and my sister just watched us.After that, my mother and sister took their turn, but it was not paragliding. They were interested to ride a horse. While they rode the horses and my father kept his eyes on them, my brothers and I were walking around and looking for some beautiful snails. I got some and my brothers got starfishes. They looked cute. Therefore, we let them go then and didn’t take it. It was almost 4 o’clock in the afternoon and we went to the cottage. I felt so happy to have great experience at Parangtritis beach. I wished someday I could come back<br />

                        Fishing at The River<br /><br />When I was in Junior High School, my father once took me to go fishing with him at the river on Sunday morning. The river lies across our oil palm plantation. We had breakfast first at home and then left early in the morning by motorcycle.<br /><br />When we arrived in our plantation, my father parked the motorcycle under the hut. He asked me to collect some dry wood and dry grass or leaves. When I already collected enough wood and dry leaves, my father set a fire in the center of the fireplace. He said that the smoke from the fire would scare some dangerous animal like bear and boar to come closer to the hut and so it would make us safer.<br /><br />After cleaning some wild grass around the hut, my father gave me a hoe and asked me to dig some soil to find worms. When I already had enough worm, I brought it to my father and we went straight to the river. We put the worm on the fishing hook as a bait to catch the fish. As a beginner fisher, I cannot apply the worm on the fishing hook well, and it look like it was about to fall of the hook, but my father said that it was okay. I threw the fishing hook into the river and wait for the fish to eat the bait, but nothing happened after a while. When I was about to get bored I saw a big prawn was slowly walking in the water. I placed the fishing hook slowly into the face of the prawn and move it up and down so the worm seemed alive. I never expected it to happen but suddenly the prawn move its hand and grabbed the worm on my fishing hook. I lift it very slowly and the prawn was still there hanging tight on the worm until I placed it on the ground and I caught it right away with my hands. My father was so surprise to see it. Before we went home, we cooked it at the hut and enjoyed it together.<br />

                        <p>The Ocean of Sorrow</p><p> </p><p>In the afternoon, a beautiful girl with a red
hooded named Aisha looked sad on the seashore. She was sitting in the dock and
kept looking at the blue ocean. The waves came crashing her feet but did not
make her moved to another place. The shore of wind which blew till stabbed her
bone did not make her eyes diverted to ocean.</p><p>That day, the sky was cloudless. She kept
looking at the blue sea till the horizon began to return. She saw the fishermen
who were getting back from the sea and bringing fishes quite a lot. The
fishermen were greeted by their family who had been waiting for them at the
edge of the ocean. Seeing something very emotional there, her tears soaked her
cheeks. She thought of his family who had gone and left her alone.</p><p>That girl hated the sea because that’s where
her family lost and died. It happened about 4 months ago when the ship that
brought them from across the island was on fire and sank in the ocean. All her
family died and lost including her mother, father, and brother. However, Aisha
survived from the accident.</p><p>









</p><p>Until now, Aisha always comes to the beach
every day to look at the ocean because from that place, she could remember her
beloved family and remember the happy memories that they went through together.
Her tears were rolling down her cheeks until the sun disappeared entirely
behind the ocean.</p><br />
