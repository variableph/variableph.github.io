                        Narrative Text<p><strong>JAWABAN:</strong></p><p>The Legend of Sangkuriang (Tangkuban Perahu)</p><p>Dayang Sumbi was a beautiful and kind hearted princess, but sometimes she was very lazy. Her hobby was weaving cloth. One day her weaving tool fell. Tumang, a male dog, came to bring back to her. As she had promised, she married him. Tuman was actually a man who had been cursed by a witch to become a dog. But sometimes he could turn back to a normal man. Dayang Sumbi and Tumang got one son. His name was Sangkuriang. He did not know that Tumang was his father because he was a dog whenever he was with him. Tumang always accompanied Sangkuriang whenever he went hunting in the woods. </p><p>When he was twelve years old, Dayang Sumbi asked Sangkuriang to bring her deer's heart. But after many days in the woods, he could not find a deer. He did not want to disappoint his mother, so he killed Tumang and brought his heart home and gave it to his mother. Because of her love to Tumang, Dayang Sumbi knew, it was his heart not a deer's heart. She got very angry at Sangkuriang. She hit him with a piece of wood on his forehead and told him to go away. Badly wounded, Sangkuriang left her and the village
</p><p>One day Sangkuriang went back to his village. He was big and strong. There he met a beautiful young woman. He fell in love with her at first sight. He did not know that she was Dayang Sumbi. She could never get older because she was granted eternal youth by the gods
</p><p>One day he approached Dayang Sumbi to propose her. Dayang Sumbi saw the bad scar on his forehead. She soon realized that he was her own son, Sangkuriang. She told him the truth again and again but he would not believe her. She was thinking hard to find a way not to marry him. Then she got an idea. She gave him a task which she thought was impossible for him to do. She asked him to make her a lake and a boat in one night. She did not know Sangkuriang had genies to help him to do the task.
</p><p>By dawn both the lake and the boat were almost done. Dayang Sumbi got very worried. She was thinking hard again to find a way to fail him. Then she had an idea. She asked the people in the village to burn the woods in the east, so that the light made all the cocks in the village crow. The genies thought that the morning was almost broken. They ran away as fast they could, leaving the boat unfinished. Knowing Dayang Sumbi cheated him, Sangkuriang got very angry. He kicked the boat so hard that it went upside down. It is now known as Mount Tangkuban Perahu.

                        <p>Jawaban &amp; Penjelasan:</p><p></p><p>THE LEGEND OF MALIN KUNDANG</p><p></p><p>A long time ago, in a small village near the beach in West Sumatra lived a woman and her son, Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang and his mother had to live hard because his father had passed away when he was a baby. Malin Kundang was a healthy, dilligent, and strong boy. He usually went to sea to catch fish. After getting fish he would bring it to his mother, or sell the caught fish in the town. One day, when Malin Kundang was sailing, he saw a merchant’s ship being raided by a band of pirates. With his bravery, Malin Kundang helped the merchant defeat the pirates. To thank him, the merchant allowed Malin Kundang to sail with him. Malin Kundang agreed in the hope to get a better life. He left his mother alone. Many years later, Malin Kundang became wealthy. He had a huge ship and a lot of crews who worked loading trading goods. He was also married to a beautiful woman. When he was sailing on his trading journey, his ship landed on a coast near a small village. The local people recognized that it was Malin Kundang, a boy from the area. The news ran fast in the town; “Malin Kundang has become rich and now he is here”. An old woman, who was Malin Kundang’s mother, ran to the beach to meet the new rich merchant. She wanted to hug him to release her sadness of being lonely after a long time. When his mother came near him, Malin Kundang who was with his beautiful wife and his ship crews denied that she was his mother. She had pleaded Malin Kundang to look at her and admit that she was her mother. But he kept refusing to do it and yelling at her. At last Malin Kundang said to her “Enough, old woman! I have never had a mother like you, a dirty and ugly woman!” After that he ordered his crews to set sail to leave the old woman who was then full of sadness and anger. Finally, feeling enraged, she cursed Malin Kundang that he would turn into a stone if he didn’t apologize to her. Malin Kundang just laughed and set sail. Suddenly a thunderstorm came in the quiet sea, wrecking his huge ship. He was thrown out to a small island. It was really too late for him to avoid his curse, he had turned into a stone.</p><p></p><p>------------------------</p><p></p><p>Indonesian Translation </p><p>LEGENDA MALIN KUNDANG</p><p></p><p>Dahulu kala, di sebuah desa kecil dekat pantai di Sumatra Barat tinggal seorang wanita dan putranya, Malin Kundang. Malin Kundang dan ibunya harus hidup keras karena ayahnya telah meninggal ketika dia masih bayi. Malin Kundang adalah anak yang sehat, rajin, dan kuat. Dia biasanya pergi ke laut untuk menangkap ikan. Setelah mendapatkan ikan, ia akan membawanya ke ibunya, atau menjual ikan yang ditangkap itu di kota. Suatu hari, ketika Malin Kundang berlayar, dia melihat kapal pedagang diserbu oleh sekelompok perompak. Dengan keberaniannya, Malin Kundang membantu pedagang mengalahkan para perompak. Untuk berterima kasih padanya, pedagang itu mengizinkan Malin Kundang untuk berlayar bersamanya. Malin Kundang setuju dengan harapan untuk mendapatkan kehidupan yang lebih baik. Dia meninggalkan ibunya sendirian. Bertahun-tahun kemudian, Malin Kundang menjadi kaya. Dia punya kapal besar dan banyak kru yang bekerja memuat barang dagangan. Ia juga menikah dengan seorang wanita cantik. Ketika dia berlayar dalam perjalanan dagangnya, kapalnya mendarat di pantai dekat sebuah desa kecil. Masyarakat setempat mengenali bahwa itu adalah Malin Kundang, seorang bocah lelaki dari daerah itu. Berita itu menyebar dengan cepat di kota; "Malin Kundang telah menjadi kaya dan sekarang dia ada di sini". Seorang wanita tua, yang mana ia adalah ibu Malin Kundang, berlari ke pantai untuk bertemu pedagang kaya baru. Dia ingin memeluknya untuk melepaskan kesedihannya karena kesepian setelah waktu yang lama. Ketika ibunya mendekati dia, Malin Kundang yang bersama istrinya yang cantik dan awak kapalnya menyangkal bahwa dia adalah ibunya. Dia telah memohon Malin Kundang untuk melihatnya dan mengakui bahwa dia adalah ibunya. Tapi dia terus menolak untuk melakukannya dan berteriak padanya. Akhirnya Malin Kundang berkata kepadanya, “Cukup, wanita tua! Saya tidak pernah memiliki ibu seperti Anda, seorang wanita yang kotor dan jelek!” Setelah itu ia memerintahkan anak buahnya untuk berlayar meninggalkan wanita tua yang saat itu penuh dengan kesedihan dan kemarahan. Akhirnya, merasa marah, dia mengutuk Malin Kundang bahwa dia akan berubah menjadi batu jika dia tidak meminta maaf padanya. Malin Kundang hanya tertawa dan berlayar. Tiba - tiba badai datang di laut yang tenang, menghancurkan kapalnya yang besar. Dia dibuang ke sebuah pulau kecil. Sudah sangat terlambat baginya untuk menghindari kutukannya, dia telah berubah menjadi batu.</p><p></p><p>Jadikan Jawaban yg terbaik yh kakkk....

princess named Snow White. Her skin was as white as snow, her lips were 
gorgeous, and her hair was shiny. She was an orphan, she lived at the 
palace belongs to her step-mother. That arrogant queen has an 
unimportant habit, which was she always asking her faithful 
Fortune-Teller, who was the most beautiful woman in the universe, and 
the answer was always the queen.


One day, the queen asking the same question to her Fortune-Teller again.


The Queen : Hey, my faithful Fortune-Teller! Who is the most beautiful 
woman in the universe? (With an arrogant pride)


Fortune-Teller : My queen, the most beautiful woman in the universe is 
Snow White. Sorry, but now you are not more beautiful than Snow White. 
(With flat expression)


The Queen : Snow White?! It is impossible! My lovely cat is more 
beautiful than her! Don’t be joking! (Surprised and angry)


Fortune-Teller : My queen, I am not joking. If you did not believe it, 
you could take a look on the mirror in your palace together with Snow 
White. Definitely, the one who is more beautiful will be…


The Queen : Enough! I don’t want to hear it! Since now, you are 
expelled! (Screaming and pointing her finger to Fortune-Teller, then 
stand up and leaving the Fortune-Teller’s house)


Fortune-Teller : My queen, I did not mean to…


Narrator : The queen left the Fortune-Teller’s house angrily. She really
 did not think there was the one who was more beautiful than her. 
Moreover, she was Snow White, her step-child. She could not accept this 
reality. When she arrived at her palace…


The Queen : It was impossible, really impossible! This was fault. Snow 
White, the child who was just sleeping-eating-sleeping-eating? That 
Fortune-Teller should be crazy! (Keep grumbling by her own self while 
walking around in her room)


Narrator : Snow White was crossing the queen’s room, than she suddenly 
stopped because she has heard her name was mentioned. She kept 
eavesdropping from the door.


The Queen : (Sat and thinking hardly). Snow White can’t be the most 
beautiful woman in this universe. (Thinking) Ah! Eureka! She must be 
vanished. Ya.


Narrator : Snow White was surprised. She kept eavesdropping.


The Queen : I must kill her! But, how is the way?

her phone and pressed some number.


The Guardian : (Across from line phone) Yes, my queen? What could I do?


The Queen : The Guardian, go to my room as soon as possible!


The Guardian : Roger! Errr, should I go now?


The Queen : Tomorrow! Grrr, of course NOW! Jerk!!


The Guardian : Ehehe, okay okay. I would be there immediately.


Narrator : Snow White moved to her room quickly, a few seconds later, 
The Guardian has come and entered The Queen’s room.


The Guardian : What’s the matter, my queen?


The Queen : I command you to kill Snow White, my step-child.


The Guardian : What?! It is impossible, my queen. I am afraid to kill a 
person. Our sin would be unforgivable and the hell would be waiting for 
us. Moreover, Snow White was kind-hearted and…


The Queen : Don’t give me a lecture! If you do not want to do it, I will
 kill your wife and your children! Now, which will you choose?


The Guardian : (Keep silent) Okay, my queen. I would obey your command. 
But, how could I kill her?


The Queen : Whatever! Stab, hit, burn, torture or induce was your 
choice. Or you want to throw her to a ravine, it is fine. Notice that, 
Snow White must die within this night. Understand?


The Guardian : Un... Understood, my queen!


Narrator : The Guardian was left The Queen’s room immediately.


(Knock knock knock)


Snow White : Come!


The Guardian : (Talking with scary face) Princess, you were called by 
The Queen. She was waiting in her room.


Narrator : Snow White felt unwell. She predicted The Queen would kill 
her. Finally, she has found an idea.


Snow White : Okay, guardian! I would be there. (Leaving her room calmly)

                            30. legenda singkat sangkuriang dalam bahasa inggris</h2><br />
                        <p>Long time ago in West Java, lived a beautiful and lovely girl named Dayang Sumbi. She lived in a shack in the middle of woods accompanied by her faithful dog named Tumang. Actually, she was a princess of a kingdom that was exiled by her father.
</p><p>
</p><p>One day when Dayang sumbi was weaving, one of her string felt into the lake. Dayang Sumbi became sad. She promised to herself that whoever found the string, if a man would be her husband and if a girl would be her sister. Unexpectedly Tumang was the one who came to bring the linen for Dayang sumbi. Finally Dayang sumbi married Tumang. Tumang was a man who cursed into a dog.
</p><p>
</p><p>After marrying Tumang, Dayang sumbi had a son named Sangkuriang. Sangkuriang was a dashing and handsome boy. He loved hunting in the forest. One day he went to the wood for hunting. He was accompanied by Tumang but he did not know that Tumang was his father. He was hunting all day long but today was not his lucky day. He did not get even just one animal. Because he had made a promise to his mother to bring a dear’s heart, Sangkuriang killed Tumang. He took and brought it to his home.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p> 
</p><p>When he got home sangkuriang gave the tumang’s heart to his mother. Dayang Sumbi didn’t realize it. She cooked that heart and ate with her son. When they finished eating, Dayang sumbi asked to Sangkuriang “where is Tumang? Why he did not come home with you?”, “Tumang had been our meal today, mom!” Replied Sangkuriang. Dayang Sumbi was angry with Sangkuriang. She hit his head with a spoon until it bleed.
</p><p>
</p><p>After that incident Sangkuriang went away from his home. He went on a journey. Dayang sumbi was sad and regretted what she had done. After years of his trip, Sangkuriang  grew into a handsome and brave man. He did not remember his home and his family. Until one day when he was hunting. He met a very pretty girl. That girl was dayang sumbi. Dayang sumbi had been blessed by god to stay young and beautiful forever.  Sangkuriang fell in love with her. Dayang Sumbi also didn’t know that the man was her son. They fell in love each other. Sangkuriang wanted to marry dayang sumbi. When they were together, Dayang sumbi saw an injury sign on sangkuriang’s head. Dayang Sumbi realized that it was sangkuriang her son and refused his marriage proposal.
</p><p>
</p><p>Sangkuriang did not accept the rejection. He still wanted to marry Dayang Sumbi. Dayang Sumbi became very frightened. She was looking for ways to stop their wedding. Dayang sumbi got an idea to ask Sangkurisng did an impossible thing as the requirement. “build a dam in Citarum river and make a great boat for me in one night!” said Dayang sumbi. “Okay I’ll do it!” Replied sangkuriang.
</p><p>
</p><p>That night sangkuriang did what was asked by a Dayang sumbi. He used his magic to call genie to help him. Seeing sangkuriang almost completed her request, Dayang Sumbi became afraid. She hit a mortar so that the chickens would be crowing. Hearing the sound of chickens, all the genie were fear and disappeared. Sangkuriang failed to marry Dayang sumbi. He knew that he had been deceived by Dayang Sumbi. He kicked the unfinished boat angrily. The ship was thrown away and became a mountain called Mount Tangkuban perahu.
