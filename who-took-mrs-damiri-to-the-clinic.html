                                            Last week , Mr. Damiri’s wife had an accident. Her youngest child, Yusuf was at home when it happened. He was playing with the new toy car. Suddenly Yusuf heard his mother calling, “Help! Help! He ran to the kitchen. His mother had burnt herself with some hot cooking oil. She was crying with pain and the pan was on fire. The other children had gone to school. Yusuf was too small to help his mother , and she was too frightened to speak sensibly to him. But he ran to the neighbor’s house and ask his neighbor to come and help his mother. The neighbor soon put the fire and took Yusuf’s mother to the clinic. When Mr Damiri came home, his wife told him what had happened . He was very proud of his sun, “when you are a man, you will be just like your father,” she saidWho took Mrs. Damiri to the clinic?

Suddenly Yusuf heard his mother calling, “Help! Help!” he ran to the kitchen. His mother had burnt herself with some hot cooking oil. She was crying with pain and the pan was on ﬁre. Mr. Damiri had gone to the ofﬁce. The other children had gone to school. Yusuf was too small to help his mother, and she was too frightened to speak sensibly to him. But he ran to the neighbour’s house and asked his neighbor to come and help his mother. The neighbor soon put out the ﬁre and took Yusuf’s mother to the clinic. When Mr. Damiri came home, his wife told him what had happened. He was very proud of his son, “When you are a man, you will be just like your father,”she said. 8. Who took Mrs. Damiri to the clinic?
